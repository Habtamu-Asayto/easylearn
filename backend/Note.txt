 Steps we will follow: 
      - Set up the git repository 
      - Set up the dev database locally 
      - Develop the Backend 
      - Develop the Frontend 
      - Set up our host server on Amazon AWS (EC2) 
      - Deploy our code 
      - Restructure our code to follow the standard folder structure 
      - Update our code base and deploy it again 

1. Set up the git repository 
- Set up the repo as a private repo on git hub 
      /sampleapp 
    - Clone the repo to your local machine and start working on 
      - Before you clone the code, create access token on github 
      - git clone  {project link} (Use the SSH link as this is a private repo)
      - If you haven't added your SSH key to your git hub account, you need to do that first  
        (We will see how to do that when we later configure our server)  
2. Set up the dev database locally 
 Set up the dev database locally 
  ------------------------------- 
    - Install MySql on your local machine 
      - https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/ 
      (If you have MAMP already installed, you can use that as well) 
    
    - Create a new database and add user to the database 
      username: demoapp ? So554Dgteb766@!!
      password: demoapp
      database name: demoapp

    - Let's desing abd create the tables we need to add employee 	

3. Develop the Backend 	
3.1. Create the "backend" Folder: 
      - To hold all your backend codes 
      - package.json (file): 
        Create the initial package.json file to track your dependencies 
          - npm init 
		  
3.2. Create the app.js (file):
      - This is the main file that we use to run and manage the backend server   
      - Let us now start writing our code 
        - Let's start by creating our webserver 
          - Install Express 
            - npm install express 
          // Import the express module 
          // Set up the port to listen to 
          // Set up the listener 
3.3.  - Let's now connect to the database 
  - To do that we need the mysql (mysql2) bridge module to connect to the database 
          - Install the mysql2 module 
            - npm install mysql2 
          // Import the mysql module  
            - We use the commonJS module system to import the modules 
            * mysql2 is faster and has more features than mysql. But they both do the same thing 
          // Define the connection parameters for the database  
          // Create the connection to the database  
          // Connect to the database 
          - Check if the connection is successful on the console
